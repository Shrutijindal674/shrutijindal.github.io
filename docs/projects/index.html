<meta name="description" content="Investigating Ageism in the Workplace among workers with Dementia 
Working with Dr. Sabrina Pit at the University of Sydney, I am exploring how ageism manifests in the workplace. Through extensive literature review and meta-analysis, we are identifying key themes, challenges faced by older adults with Younger onset Dementia, and potential strategies to mitigate its effects.">

<meta name="description" content="Factors Affecting Women's Career Aspirations After Motherhood
Collaborated with Dr. Devjani Chatterjee at the Indian Institute of Management Kashipur, I conducted a quantitative study on how cultural assumptions about gender and parenthood shape the career aspirations of women. This research sheds light on the aspirations of middle- and upper-class young women, both with and without children.">

<meta name="description" content="Role of Attention in Reading Academic language (AL) Using the Navon Task 
At the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, I worked with Prof. Sanjay Chandrasekharan to investigate the role of attention in reading Academic Language using the Navon task with Psytoolkit. This project involved constructing a system simulation to understand the transition to scientific thinking.">

<meta name="description" content="Enhancing Memory Encoding for Improved Retrieval:Investigating the Effects of Series and Simultaneous Presentations on Recall Performance
In collaboration with Professor Robert Bjork at UCLA, I executed a research design to eliminate the Serial Position Effect on word retrieval. By collecting data from 400 students across different experimental conditions, we increased the retrieval of words by 70% without extra efforts or expenditure.">
