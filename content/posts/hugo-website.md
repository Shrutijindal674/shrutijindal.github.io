# !!! UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!!

This is a concise, step-by-step guide on how to build a website with Hugo, and deploy/host it on Github Pages. Just like this one.

## Prerequisites/installations

1. Have Hugo extended version on your computer (https://gohugo.io/installation/)

> [Hugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RKpf3rK57I) is a website generator/building framework written in [Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=446E-r0rXHI)

2. Have `git` on your computer (https://git-scm.com/)

> [Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) is a version control manager, a software that tracks the changes of your files in a project over time

3. Have a Github account (https://github.com/)

> [GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdAHXoRtos) is a website and a hosting service that allows you to manage your git repositories remotely (on the internet)

Essentially, any website (in fact any software) is just a folder with a bunch of text files organized in precise ways. In this context, terms such as "Hugo project", "Git repo", or "root directory" all refer to the same folder. In this tutorial we will generate this folder and the necessary files with the help of Hugo (the tool), and we will publish it as a git repository (to be able to make changes easily) on GitHub (the storage).

We will also learn how to use an existing [Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/) to supply the looks for our website, and I will show you how to build and deploy your website on GitHub Pages, a feature on GitHub with this exact purpose (and how to automate deployment).

Lastly, we want to manage our files and folder structures conveniently, so we need a text/code editor.

4. Have Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

> [VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMxo3T_MTvY) is a lightweight code editor that provides you with an integrated environment to inspect, edit, and manage your files; with extensions to accommodate every possible technical need later.

**All the above programs are free and open-source.**
