#### [CV](/files/cv.pdf "Open/download CV as a pdf")

Hello! I am a fresh Ph.D. graduate at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), and I am using digital technologies in philological and humanities research. I am interested in linguistic and cultural exchange along historic trade routes in Asia, especially around the Indian Ocean world and the Maritime Silk Road. My focus is on how to collect, process, analyze, and present humanities data in new and exciting ways.

I have received training in traditional philology from various *Eastern Languages and Cultures* departments at the [Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE)](https://www.btk.elte.hu/en/) in Budapest, including Semitic and Arabic studies, Korean studies, Islamic studies, and Indology. In Hong Kong I have studied corpus linguistics and computational linguistics at [PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/cbs/), and also learned about various techniques in natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and a bit of data science.



I am currently undertaking a [project](https://partigabor.github.io/spice/) about spices and spice names and their diffusion around the globe, under the supervision of [Prof. Chu-Ren Huang](https://www.humanities.hk/fellowsdirectory/huangchuren).



The dissertation that serves as a basis for this database was prepared at the [Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/study/research-postgraduate-programme/phd-or-mphil-study) (soon to be renamed to Department of Linguistics and Language Sciences) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/), under the supervision of [Prof. Chu-Ren Huang](https://www.humanities.hk/fellowsdirectory/huangchuren), and funded by the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html).
