My journey has been marked by significant collaborations, including an independent project at the [Bjork Learning and Forgetting Lab at UCLA](https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty/page/bjorkr), where I've been working with Professor Robert Bjork to revolutionize learning methods. Our research has increased word retrieval by 70%, a testament to innovation and determination.

I've also had the privilege of working with esteemed institutions such as the [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](http://www.tifr.res.in/), [Indian Institute of Management Kashipur](https://www.iimkashipur.ac.in/), and [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/). My research spans diverse topics, from ageism during COVID-19 to the factors affecting women's career aspirations after motherhood.

In the realm of education, I've served as a Visiting Faculty in Psychology, preparing students for entrance exams and contributing to media coverage on topics such as [anxiety](http://risingkashmir.com/mummymy-phone-is-not-a-cause-of-my-anxiety-88dbf459-a4cd-4c1a-ae6a-b70071d7e35b)) and [ageism](http://risingkashmir.com/eliminating-ageism-based-mental-health-concerns-among-older-workers-in-an-organizational-setting-6e7685b3-8d38-4b30-b8e8-974d16b44c37).

My commitment to community development is reflected in my work with [Art of Living](https://www.artofliving.org/) and [Tihar Prisons](https://www.tihartiharprisons.nic.in/), where I've applied psychological principles to real-world challenges, from raising funds for holistic development to improving mental health among inmates. My professional journey is a blend of innovation, education, community service, and achievement. It's a reflection of my passion for understanding the human psyche and my dedication to contributing to the field of cognitive psychology and education.

Write me as I continue to explore, innovate, and inspire in the ever-evolving world of cognitive psychology and education.
