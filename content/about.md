Hello! I am a fresh Ph.D. graduate at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), and I am using digital technologies in philological and humanities research.

I have received training in traditional philology from various *Eastern Languages and Cultures* departments at [ELTE](https://www.btk.elte.hu/en/) in Budapest, including Semitic and Arabic studies, Korean studies, Islamic studies, and Indology. In Hong Kong I have studied corpus linguistics and computational linguistics at [PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/cbs/), and learned about various techniques using artificial intelligence and machine learning in the language sciences.

I am currently undertaking a [project](https://partigabor.github.io/spice/) about spices and spice names and their diffusion around the globe, under the supervision of [Prof. Chu-Ren Huang](https://www.humanities.hk/fellowsdirectory/huangchuren).
